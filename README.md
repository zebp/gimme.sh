# gimme.sh

A registry of many install-via-curl install scripts on an easy to remember domain.

## WIP

It's currently early days for this project, not many packages are available with no way to search what is available.

## Example

Installing software is as simple as `curl`ing into your shell of choice!

```sh
curl -sL https://gimme.sh/rush | bash
```

## Available Software

Currently only a few packages are available, feel free to open a PR if you'd like to see more.
